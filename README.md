Simple TCP chat written in Ruby

To start server, run ruby server.rb
To start client, run ruby client.rb

You can run as many clients as you wish (at least I think so)
By default, communication is going by localhost, on port 8000, but you can simply change it in code.

To send a file, input 'FILE: {filename}' and press enter.
